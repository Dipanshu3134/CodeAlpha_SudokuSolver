I developed a Sudoku solver in C++ as a project to enhance my programming skills. This project primarily uses classes, functions, and vectors, allowing me to delve deep into object-oriented programming and data structures. I Implemented a strategy based on logical deduction and constraint propagation to solve puzzles. Developed modular functions to apply Sudoku rules and constraints to deduce numbers and utilized vectors to efficiently store and manage the Sudoku grid. Solves puzzles using logical techniques, providing a unique approach compared to traditional methods. Efficiently handles standard Sudoku puzzles. User-friendly interface for input and output via the console.
